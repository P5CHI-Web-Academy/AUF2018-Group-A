Project Architecture:

1) **Vapor**
Reference: [https://vapor.codes](https://vapor.codes)
Vapor is a Web Framework for Swift that works on macOS and Ubuntu, and all of the packages that Vapor offers.

Vapor is the most used web framework for Swift. It provides a beautifully expressive and easy to use foundation for your next website or API.

2) **React - Native**
Reference: [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

React Native combines smoothly with components written in Objective-C, Java, or Swift. It&#39;s simple to drop down to native code if you need to optimize a few aspects of your application. It&#39;s also easy to build part of your app in React Native, and part of your app using native code directly.

3) **MongoDB**

Reference: [https://www.mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com%5C)

MongoDB&#39;s document model is simple for developers to learn and use, while still providing all the capabilities needed to meet the most complex requirements at any scale. We provide drivers for 10+ languages, and the community has built dozens more.
