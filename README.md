1) **Django**
Reference: [https://www.djangoproject.com/](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source. 

2) **React - Native**
Reference: [https://facebook.github.io/react-native/](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

React Native combines smoothly with components written in Objective-C, Java, or Swift. It&#39;s simple to drop down to native code if you need to optimize a few aspects of your application. It&#39;s also easy to build part of your app in React Native, and part of your app using native code directly.

3) **SQLite**

Reference: [https://www.sqlite.org/features.html](https://www.sqlite.org/features.html)
Suggested Uses For SQLite:

Database For The Internet Of Things. SQLite is popular choice for the database engine in cellphones, PDAs, MP3 players, set-top boxes, and other electronic gadgets. SQLite has a small code footprint, makes efficient use of memory, disk space, and disk bandwidth, is highly reliable, and requires no maintenance from a Database Administrator.

Application File Format. Rather than using fopen() to write XML, JSON, CSV, or some proprietary format into disk files used by your application, use an SQLite database. You'll avoid having to write and troubleshoot a parser, your data will be more easily accessible and cross-platform, and your updates will be transactional. 

Stand-in For An Enterprise RDBMS. SQLite is often used as a surrogate for an enterprise RDBMS for demonstration purposes or for testing. SQLite is fast and requires no setup, which takes a lot of the hassle out of testing and which makes demos perky and easy to launch.


Common benefits :

- All selected technologies are free and open-source

- All of them are progressive and relative new technologies
